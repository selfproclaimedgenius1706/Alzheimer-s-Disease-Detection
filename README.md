# Alzheimer-s-Disease-Detection
**I. INTRODUCTION **
- This repository belongs to a research team of four high school students at the Brain Health Lab, Ho Chi Minh International University, Vietnam, under the supervision of Dr.Huong Thi Thanh Ha and Dr.Lua Thi Ngo.
- Our research has two objectives :
1. Implement and optimize the performance of BERT in the task of Alzheimer's disease detection based on language impairment through audio transcript. The dataset we use in the research is provided by the DementiaBank.
2. Compare the perfomance of 5 BERT family models: BERT, RoBERTa, AlBERT, DistilBERT and DeBERTa for the same task based on various evaluation metrics (confusion matrix, f1, recall, precision,...)
